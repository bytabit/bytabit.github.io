<b>Hello world</b> we are pleased to announce the Bytabit Fiat Trader project and to make public our current prototype code and website. We are currently heads down focused on coding and may not post updates here as often as we would like to. Please check out our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bytabit/fiat-trader" target="_blank">Bitbucket repository</a> to follow our progress. Once our alpha release is ready for testing we will post all the fun details.
