See below for a simple pre-alpha demo of a **Fiat Trader** _unhappy_ path trade.  The unhappy path is when the seller does NOT delivers the sold fiat currency to the buyer or the buyer does NOT correctly acknowledges receipt of the fiat currency. In this scenario the buyer or seller requests that the notary review evidence that the fiat currency was delivered or not. Based on what the notary finds either the trade goes through and the seller receives their bitcoin payment (plus the buyers bond/deposit amount).  Or the buyer is refunded their escrowed bitcoin (plus the sellers bond/deposit). The losing party in each case must also pay the notary fee.
